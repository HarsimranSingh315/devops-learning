# Week 1: Linux Fundamentals

## Project: System Monitoring Scripts

### What I Built
Three bash scripts to monitor system health on Linux:
1. **system_monitor.sh** - Comprehensive system monitoring
2. **network_check.sh** - Network connectivity checker
3. **disk_alert.sh** - Disk usage alerting

### Environment
- AWS EC2 t2.micro (Amazon Linux 2023)
- Deployed on real cloud infrastructure

### How to Run
```bash
chmod +x *.sh
./system_monitor.sh
./network_check.sh
./disk_alert.sh
```

### What I Learned
- Bash scripting fundamentals (variables, loops, conditionals)
- System monitoring commands (df, free, ps)
- File redirection and logging
- SSH key management and EC2 access
- Working in cloud environment from day 1
